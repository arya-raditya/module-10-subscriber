> a. What is amqp?

AMQP stands for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol. It is an open standard application layer protocol specifically designed for message-oriented middleware, enabling different applications or components of an application to communicate by sending and receiving messages. AMQP defines a set of rules for how messages are structured, routed, queued, and acknowledged, ensuring reliable and interoperable message exchange between disparate systems, regardless of the programming languages or platforms they use. This protocol facilitates asynchronous communication, meaning senders can publish messages without waiting for immediate processing by receivers, which helps in building decoupled and scalable systems. Message brokers like RabbitMQ are prominent examples of software that implement the AMQP specification to manage message queues and exchanges.

> b. What does it mean? guest:guest@localhost:5672 , what is the first guest, and what is the second guest, and what is localhost:5672 is for?

The string guest:guest@localhost:5672 is a connection URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) commonly used by applications to establish a connection with an AMQP message broker, such as RabbitMQ. Within this URI, the first guest signifies the username that the client will use to authenticate with the broker. The second guest, appearing after the colon and before the "@" symbol, represents the password associated with that username. Therefore, the client is attempting to log in as user "guest" with the password "guest". The portion localhost:5672 specifies the network address of the AMQP broker; localhost indicates that the broker is running on the same machine as the client application, and 5672 is the port number on that machine where the broker is listening for incoming AMQP connections, this being the standard default port for AMQP. In essence, this entire string instructs a client to connect to a locally running AMQP broker on port 5672 using the default "guest" credentials.
